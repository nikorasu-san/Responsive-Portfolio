# Responsive-Portfolio

Creating a mock portfolio site that is responsive across various screens

## Notes

### Known issues

- The site-responsiveness performs well on Chrome dev tools. However the site does not look well on my personal iPhone 7.

- There is some border oddness in the top right for some browser sizes. The border becomes thinner in that area.

## Future Recommendations

- Find a better solution for the header to resolve the border issues.

- Find a way to resolve the header for smaller devices

- Build the site with block-sizing from the start. Adding it later caused too many issues with the image overlays on the Portfolio page.
